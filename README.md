# GTA VI-Inspired Navbar

Hey! This is a fun, open source navbar that takes a ton of inspiration from the official [GTA VI website](https://www.rockstargames.com/gta6/). It’s built to look and feel just like the real thing, but you can totally tweak it and drop it into your own projects however you want.

## Features

- Super slick, animated navigation just like GTA VI’s site
- Made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and React
- Looks great on any device, with smooth transitions
- Easy to customize and totally open source

- Dark mode coming soon!
